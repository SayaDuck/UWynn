Yoooo hello it's me sayaduck

After wasting hours in #questions, I realized that searching up past answers was really inefficient. So I made this in half a day from the shell of an old project that didn't even get off the ground. [Here's the repo](https://github.com/UWynn/UWynn.github.io) if you're interested, it's a jekyll blog that's been messed with to fit my usecase.

Shoutout to [Aarontti](https://twitter.com/aarontti) for the indefinitely temporary favicon/logo.


I guess I can plug my stuff so here, [educational wynncraft content](https://www.youtube.com/c/SayaDuck).

If you want to talk about/help UWynn, [here's the discord](https://discord.gg/qMZEmqm7Zh).
