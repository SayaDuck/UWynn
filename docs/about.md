Yoooo hello it's me saya duck

After wasting hours in #questions, I realized that searching up past answers was really inefficient. So I made this in half a day from the shell of an old project that didn't even get off the ground. [Here's the repo](https://github.com/UWynn/UWynn.github.io) if you're interested, it's a jekyll blog that's been messed with to fit my usecase. Big thanks to [derekeder's csv-to-html-table](https://github.com/derekeder/csv-to-html-table) for making this easy.


I guess I can plug my stuff so here, [educational wynncraft content](https://www.youtube.com/c/SayaDuck).
